![master branch status](https://travis-ci.org/gitqwerty777/BigNumber.svg?branch=master)

Some useful functions to deal with big integer number(bigger than long long)

## Use this code for online judge

merge all codes to one file in following order:
1. bigNumber.h
2. bigNumber.hpp
3. bigNumber.cpp
4. main function(your code)

and delete `#include "bigNumber.h"`, `#include "bigNumber.hpp"`

> maybe I will write a program to make it automatically merge
